# Heartbeat

## A beating heart animation created by css keyframes that runs infinitely

The whole page is in a container that centres it's child elements at the centre of the page.\
A simple beat animation is used for the pulsating heart and the circle.\
However, the beating part of the circle has an **opacity of 0.3**.\
The rest of the design is related to centring the circle and it's heart.
